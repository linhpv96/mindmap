## Core Java
### Memory Management
#### What is JVM?
#### What is JIT?
JIT (Just-in-Time) compiler is part of JRE (Java Runtime Environment) used to improve Java application performance during runtime.
* Source code is compiled with javac compiler to form bytecode.
* Bytecode is passed to JVM.
* JIT in JVM compiles bytecode into native machine code at runtime.
* JIT activates when a method is invoked. For compiled methods, JVM calls the compiled code directly, instead of interpreting, increasing performance and execution speed.
